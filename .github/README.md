## üöÄ Quick Start Install

Ready to deploy Striae? Follow these steps to get your own instance running:

### Prerequisites

- **Cloudflare Account** with a registered domain
- **Firebase Project** with Authentication enabled and MFA configured
- **SendLayer Account** for email services
- **Node.js** v20+ and Git

### Cloudflare Services Setup

Set up these Cloudflare services first:

- **Turnstile** (bot protection) - Note site/secret keys
- **Images** (file storage) - Note account ID, hash, API token, HMAC key
- **KV** (user database) - Create namespace, note UUID
- **R2** (data and audit storage) - Create two buckets, configure CORS (see [installation guide](https://developers.striae.org/striae-dev/get-started/installation-guide#24-cloudflare-r2-setup))

### Deployment Steps

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repository to your account and clone it locally

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/striae.git
   cd striae
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install all required packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy Everything**: Run the unified deployment command

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:all
   ```

   The script will interactively prompt you for all configuration values including Firebase settings, Cloudflare credentials, and custom domains (for Workers).

4. **Test & Verify**: Test authentication, file uploads, and core features

### What Gets Deployed

- ‚úÖ 7 Cloudflare Workers (backend microservices)
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Pages frontend
- ‚úÖ All environment variables and secrets
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration
- ‚úÖ Worker-to-worker communication

**Total setup time**: ~30-45 minutes

## [2025-08-10] - Development Update

### Striae Development Indefinitely Suspended

Some of you know that at the end of 2024, I‚Äôd been working on a personal project close to my heart ‚Äî Striae, a¬†Firearms Examiner‚Äôs Comparison Companion.

The goal was simple but powerful: give firearms examiners a secure, organized way to¬†upload bullet and cartridge case comparison images, link them to specific cases, and make¬†notations directly tied to each image.

#### ‚úÖ Core Features Built

- User login & account management
- Case management for organized workflows
- Upload images tied to cases
- Make and store notations linked to each specific image

#### üîí Security Measures Implemented

- üîê Firebase Authentication for login and admin management
- üîê Encryption in transit and at rest
- üîê Data segregation/isolation
- üîê Controlled access & monitoring
- üîê Comprehensive audit trail system for forensic accountability

#### üîÆ Future Outlook

Unfortunately, a few significant life upheavals forced me to pause development before reaching the¬†printing tools and live display functions¬†I had envisioned.

Rather than let it fade away in a private, closed folder, I‚Äôve¬†opened the code archive to the public. Every project that I had built in the previous few years has been founded on the principle of contributing to the public good. My hope is that someone with the skills and interest might pick up where I left off ‚Äî improve it, adapt it, and maybe even take¬†Striae¬†further than I imagined. If that sounds like you (or you know someone who'd be interested), the code is now available for anyone to view and build upon. If circumstances allow, I may resume development in the future and take this to the finish line.
