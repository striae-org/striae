## üîê Login & Authentication

**Q: How do I log into Striae for the first time?**

A: When logging into Striae for the first time, new users follow a straightforward process designed to keep your account secure. First, you'll register by providing your work email, choosing a strong password, and filling in personal details like your name and lab or company information. It‚Äôs important to make sure your organization is entered correctly. You won‚Äôt be able to change it later, unless you contact support.

After registering, an important step is verifying your email‚Äîthis confirms your identity and activates your account. Lastly, setting up two-factor authentication (MFA) with your mobile phone adds an additional security layer by requiring SMS verification codes each time you log in. This approach ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive forensic data.

**Q: What are the password requirements for Striae?**

A: For maximum security, Striae enforces strong password rules. Your password must be at least 10 characters long and include a mix of capital letters, numbers, and special characters such as !@#$%^&\*. This complexity helps protect your account from unauthorized access, aligning with industry best practices for safeguarding forensic and case data.

**Q: Why is two-factor authentication required?**

A: Two-factor authentication (MFA) is crucial because it significantly enhances your account‚Äôs security. With MFA enabled, even if someone knows your password, they cannot log in without also having access to your registered phone to receive SMS verification codes. Because Striae handles sensitive forensic information, complying with strict security standards is essential. MFA helps prevent unauthorized access and protects the integrity of your case management.

**Q: What is a "Case Review Account Only" and when should I use it?**

A: A "Case Review Account Only" is a specialized account type designed for cross-agency collaboration and confirmations. This option is essential when you need to review or confirm cases from a different Striae instance or agency that uses a separate Firebase Authentication database. Since confirmations can only be completed by users within the same instance and Firebase database, reviewers from external agencies must create a Case Review Account to successfully complete confirmations. This ensures proper cross-jurisdictional collaboration while maintaining security boundaries between different organizational instances of Striae. When registering, simply toggle the "Case Review Account Only" option to "Yes" if you're specifically joining to review cases from another agency or instance.

***

## üìä Case Management

**Q: How do I start working on a new case?**

A: Getting started with a new case in Striae is simple and intuitive. Begin by using the case management panel on the left sidebar after logging in. You can either create a completely new case or load one you‚Äôve worked on before. Once the case is active, upload images that relate to your evidence files. After your images are uploaded and selected, you can start adding detailed annotations. The ‚ÄúImage Notes‚Äù section is where you enter case-specific information and descriptive annotations, helping organize your evidence clearly and professionally.

**Q: What file formats does Striae support for images?**

A: Striae supports the most common and reliable image formats used in forensic documentation, including PNG and JPEG. PNG is recommended especially for screenshots or images requiring sharp detail, while JPEG is ideal for photographs with gradients or complex textures. The system also supports GIF, WEBP, and SVG formats. To maintain smooth operation, Striae suggests keeping image file sizes under 10MB to ensure quick uploads and efficient processing.

***

## üì• Case Import & Review System

**Q: How do I import a case that was shared with me?**

A: To import a shared case, use the "Import Case" feature in the case management panel. Click "Import Case" and select the ZIP file that was shared with you (this should be a complete case export from another Striae user). Only ZIP files (.zip) exported from Striae are accepted for security reasons. Once uploaded, the system will extract and import all case data, images, and annotations. The imported case will be added to your case list and you can immediately start reviewing the annotations and data.

**Q: What happens when I import a case - can I edit it?**

A: Imported cases are automatically set to **read-only mode** to preserve the integrity of the original work. You can view all annotations, images, case details, and generate PDF reports, but you cannot modify any of the data, annotations, or upload new images. This read-only protection ensures that imported forensic evidence maintains its original state for chain of custody and audit purposes. If you need to work with similar data, create a new case instead.

**Q: Can I tell if a case was imported from someone else?**

A: Yes! Imported cases are clearly marked with a special "Read-Only" badge in the case management panel and throughout the interface. Additionally, you'll see read-only indicators on all editing features, and the case review panel will display "Read-Only Mode" status. This visual distinction helps you immediately identify which cases are your original work versus cases that were shared with you.

**Q: What's included when I import a case ZIP file?**

A: When you import a case ZIP file, you receive the complete case package including all original images, comprehensive annotation data (all 22 data fields), box annotations with precise coordinates and colors, case metadata and timestamps, and file organization exactly as it was in the original case. The import process preserves all visual elements, classifications, support levels, and detailed notes to maintain complete forensic documentation.

**Q: Why can't I import other file types besides ZIP files?**

A: Striae only accepts ZIP files for case import to ensure security and data integrity. ZIP files from Striae exports contain a verified structure with all necessary components (images, data files, metadata) in a standardized format. This restriction prevents potential security issues from unknown file types and ensures that only legitimate Striae case exports can be imported, maintaining the chain of custody for forensic evidence.

**Q: How does Striae detect if imported case data has been tampered with?**

A: Striae includes advanced cryptographic hash validation to ensure the integrity of imported case data. When a case is exported, the system generates a calculated SHA-256 hash based on the core case data content. During import, Striae automatically recalculates this hash and compares it to the original recorded value. If the hashes don't match, the import will be blocked with a clear error message indicating that the file may have been tampered with or corrupted. This validation protects the chain of custody by ensuring that any modifications to the case data since export are immediately detected, maintaining the integrity required for forensic evidence handling.

**Q: What should I do if my case import fails?**

A: If case import fails, first verify that you're uploading a valid ZIP file exported from Striae. Check that the file isn't corrupted and that you have a stable internet connection. The system will display specific error messages to help diagnose the issue. Common problems include invalid file formats (ensure it's a .zip file), corrupted ZIP files, network connectivity issues, or data hash validation failures (indicating the file may have been modified since export). If problems persist, try importing the case again, requesting a new data export, or contact support with details about the error message.

## üì§ Case Data Export

**Q: How do I export my case data from Striae?**

A: Striae offers comprehensive case export functionality with multiple format options. To export a single case, enter the case number in the case management panel, select your preferred format (JSON, CSV, or Excel), and click "Export Case Data." For bulk exports, choose your format and click "Export All Cases" to download all your cases at once. The system provides real-time progress tracking and automatically generates properly named files for easy organization.

**Q: What export formats are available and when should I use each?**

A: Striae supports three export formats, each optimized for different use cases:

- **JSON Format**: Choose this for technical analysis, database integration, or when you need structured data with complete hierarchy preservation. JSON provides the most compact file size and maintains all data relationships.

- **CSV Format**: Ideal for single case exports when you need spreadsheet analysis. CSV files include all 22 annotation fields in organized columns, perfect for Excel, Google Sheets, or statistical analysis tools like R.

- **Excel Format**: Best for bulk exports involving multiple cases. Excel files feature organized worksheets with summary statistics and individual case details, plus built-in analysis and formatting capabilities.

**Note**: When you choose to include images with your export, the system automatically packages everything in a ZIP file containing both the data files and all original images, regardless of which format you select.

**Q: What data is included in exported case files?**

A: All export formats include identical, comprehensive data to ensure complete documentation:

- Complete annotation information (all 22 data fields including case identifiers, visual elements, classifications, and options)
- Box annotation details with precise coordinates and visual properties
- Case metadata including file information, upload dates, and case statistics
- Export tracking information and error handling details
- Timestamps and user attribution for accountability
- File IDs, original filenames, and complete annotation data for each file in the case

**Q: Can I export all my cases at once?**

A: Yes! The bulk export feature allows you to export all your cases in a single operation. Choose between JSON format (single comprehensive file) or Excel format (multi-worksheet file with summary data). The system provides real-time progress tracking showing "Exporting case X of Y: [Case Name]" and continues processing even if individual cases encounter errors. Large exports with many cases may take several minutes to complete.

**Q: How does the progress tracking work during bulk exports?**

A: Striae provides comprehensive progress monitoring during bulk exports. You'll see a real-time progress bar showing completion percentage, a case counter displaying which case is currently being processed, and detailed status updates. The system handles errors gracefully‚Äîfailed cases are noted but don't stop the export process, ensuring you get complete data for all accessible cases.

**Q: What are the file naming conventions for exports?**

A: Striae uses intelligent, descriptive file naming to keep your exports organized:

- **Single Case JSON**: `striae-case-export-[CASE-NUMBER]-[DATE].json`
- **Single Case CSV**: `striae-case-export-[CASE-NUMBER]-[DATE].csv`
- **Single Case with Images**: `striae-case-export-[CASE-NUMBER]-[DATE].zip` (contains data files + images)
- **Bulk JSON**: `striae-all-cases-export-[DATE].json`
- **Bulk Excel**: `striae-all-cases-detailed-[DATE].xlsx`

All files include timestamps to prevent naming conflicts and ensure proper version control.

**Q: My export seems stuck or slow. What should I do?**

A: Export speed depends on several factors. For stuck exports, first check your internet connection and wait for the current case to complete processing. If the export appears frozen, refresh the page and try again. Large bulk exports with many cases naturally take longer. Ensure you have a stable, high-speed internet connection for optimal performance.

**Q: The export download didn't start. How do I fix this?**

A: Download issues are usually browser-related. Check your browser's download settings and permissions, ensuring popup blockers aren't preventing downloads. Try using a different browser if issues persist‚ÄîChrome is recommended for best compatibility. Clear your browser cache or try an incognito/private window if problems continue.

**Q: Can I export cases that don't have any annotations?**

A: Yes, Striae will export all cases regardless of whether they contain annotations. Cases without annotations will still include file information, case metadata, and basic case details. The export system distinguishes between cases with and without annotations in the summary data, providing complete documentation of your case portfolio.

**Q: How do ZIP exports work and what's included?**

A: ZIP exports are created automatically when you choose to include images with your case export. Regardless of whether you select JSON or CSV format, checking the "Include Images" option will package your selected data format along with all original case images into a comprehensive ZIP archive file.

**Q: What's the structure of a ZIP export file?**

A: When you include images in your export, the ZIP file is organized for easy navigation:

- **Data Files**: Your selected format (JSON or CSV) is included in the root directory
- **Images Folder**: All original case images are organized in a dedicated `images/` directory within the ZIP
- **README File**: A helpful text file explaining the contents and structure of the export
- **Organized Layout**: Files are clearly named and structured for immediate use and archiving

**Q: Can I choose whether to include images in my export?**

A: Yes! For single case exports, you'll see a checkbox option labeled "Include Images." When unchecked, you'll receive your data in the selected format (JSON or CSV) as a single file. When checked, the system automatically creates a ZIP package containing both your data file and all case images in an organized structure.

**Q: How long do exports with images take?**

A: Export time depends on the number and size of images in your case. Cases with just a few small images may complete in seconds, while cases with many images may take several minutes. The system provides real-time progress updates showing download progress for images and ZIP file creation. Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the best experience.

**Q: What happens if some images fail to download during export with images?**

A: Striae handles image download failures gracefully. If some images can't be downloaded (due to network issues or file problems), the export will still complete with the available images and data files. A detailed error log in the ZIP file will indicate which images couldn't be included, so you can identify and potentially retry downloading specific files if needed.

**Q: Are there any file size limits for exports with images?**

A: While individual images are limited to 10MB during upload, the total export file size depends on how many images are in your case. Cases with many large images will create correspondingly large ZIP files. Most browsers can handle ZIP files up to several hundred megabytes, but very large cases may take longer to download. Consider your internet connection speed when exporting cases with many large images.

**Q: Can I use exports with images for audits, legal proceedings, or evidence sharing?**

A: Absolutely! Exports with images are ideal for audits or legal proceedings because they provide complete case documentation in a single, organized package. The structured format with original images and comprehensive data makes it easy to share complete evidence packages with auditors, attorneys, or other forensic examiners. The inclusion of both data formats ensures compatibility with various analysis tools and documentation requirements.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many cases I can export at once?**

A: There's no specific limit to the number of cases you can export simultaneously. However, very large exports (hundreds of cases) may take considerable time to process and could be affected by browser timeout limitations.

**Q: Can I import case data?**

A: No. Data import functionality into regular cases is not permitted to ensure the integrity and security of forensic data stored with Striae. Imported data could introduce inconsistencies or compromise chain-of-custody, so Striae focuses solely on secure case creation, management, and annotation within the platform only. The only import functionality available is for read-only case review, as described in the [Case Import & Review System](https://help.striae.org/striae-users-guide/case-management/striae-case-management#case-import-and-review-system) section.

## üéØ Image Annotation

**Q: What types of annotations can I add to my images?**

A: Striae offers a rich set of six annotation tools designed specifically for firearms examination and forensic comparison. You can add case and item numbers to image corners for clear identification. Class characteristics allow you to document technical details like land impressions or primer shear. Index marks let you highlight the specific comparison point shown in the selected image using colorful borders or alphanumeric labels. The support level tool captures your analytical conclusion‚Äîwhether the evidence supports identification, exclusion, or remains inconclusive. There‚Äôs also a confirmation field for adding reviewer signatures and dates in identifications. Box annotations allow you to draw colored rectangles around specific areas of interest. Finally, the additional notes tool enables you to record detailed observations that provide further context.

**Q: Can I preview my annotations before creating the PDF report?**

A: Absolutely! The annotation toolbar makes it easy to toggle each annotation type on or off in real time. This way, you can see exactly how your final PDF will look while you work, ensuring that everything is properly displayed according to your documentation needs before you generate the report.

**Q: What‚Äôs the difference between Color Index and Number/Letter Index?**

A: Both tools serve to visually mark comparison points, but they do so differently. The Color Index surrounds the entire image with a distinctive colored border, which makes it very clear and immediately recognizable. This method is recommended when you want strong visual emphasis. The Number/Letter Index displays alphanumeric identifiers above the image, which can be useful for referencing specific comparison areas more precisely in your notes. Both systems help maintain clarity and assist in peer review or courtroom presentation.

**Q: How do I use box annotations to highlight specific areas?**

A: Box annotations allow you to draw colored rectangular highlights directly on your images to emphasize specific areas of interest. First, click the Box tool in the annotation toolbar to activate box drawing mode. A color picker will appear, allowing you to select from multiple colors. Then simply click and drag on the image to draw a rectangular box around the area you want to highlight. You can delete boxes after creation by right-clicking or double-clicking them if you've made a mistake. This tool is particularly useful for pointing out specific striae, class characteristics, or other significant comparison points.

**Q: Can I use multiple colors for different box annotations on the same image?**

A: Yes! You can use multiple colors for different box annotations on the same image. Each time you activate the Box tool, you can select a different color from the color picker before drawing. This allows you to color-code different types of features‚Äîfor example, you might use red boxes for aligned striae and blue boxes for firing pin impressions. All box annotations, regardless of color, are preserved in the PDF output with their exact colors and positions.

**Q: Can I remove or edit box annotations after I've drawn them?**

A: Absolutely! Box annotations are deletable after creation. Simply right-click or double-click on the box to delete it. You can also hide all box annotations using the Box tool button in the toolbar without permanently deleting them. They won't be visible in the PDF if the Box tool is toggled off, but they remain saved in your case for future reference.

**Q: Will my box annotations appear in the PDF report?**

A: Yes, all box annotations are preserved in the PDF output with the same colors and positions as shown on screen. Make sure the Box tool is toggled on in the annotation toolbar before generating your PDF to ensure the boxes appear in your report. The boxes will be displayed as colored rectangular overlays on your image, maintaining their exact placement and colors for professional documentation and presentation.

**Q: Is my original image edited to include the box annotations?**

A: No! Your original image remains unaltered. The box annotations are overlaid on the image in the canvas and during the PDF generation process, but they do *not* modify the original file. This means you can always revert to the unannotated image if needed. Striae does not edit or change your original images in any way, ensuring the integrity of your evidence files is maintained. This holds true for all annotation types, including case numbers, class characteristics, index marks, and support level indicators; they are stored in a separate data structure and rendered dynamically without altering the original images.

## ‚úÖ Authenticated Confirmations System

**Q: What is the Authenticated Confirmations System?**

A: The Authenticated Confirmations System provides a secure, digital workflow for independent verification of firearms identification conclusions. It allows reviewing examiners to confirm original findings using authenticated digital signatures, unique confirmation identifiers, and cryptographic validation. The system maintains forensic integrity while providing structured documentation for technical reviews and official reports.

**Q: How does the confirmation workflow work between examiners?**

A: The workflow involves two examiners: the Original Examiner (OE) who performs the initial analysis, and the Reviewing Examiner (RE) who provides independent confirmation. The process flows as follows: OE completes their examination and marks images requiring confirmation, then exports the case as a ZIP package. RE imports the package into read-only mode, conducts independent physical examination, and provides digital confirmation through Striae. RE exports the confirmation data back to OE, who imports it to complete the documentation process.

**Q: What does "Include confirmation" mean when I'm annotating images?**

A: When you check "Include confirmation" in the Image Notes sidebar, you're flagging that specific image as requiring independent verification from another examiner. This is typically used for identification conclusions where departmental protocols require a second examiner to confirm your findings. Images marked for confirmation will show up in exports and can receive digital confirmations from reviewing examiners.

**Q: How do I export a case for confirmation review?**

A: To export for confirmation review, navigate to Case Export in the sidebar, select "ZIP Package" format with JSON data format, ensure "Include Images" is selected, and click "Export Case." This creates a complete package containing all case data, images, and metadata with cryptographic hashes for integrity verification. Transfer this ZIP file securely to the reviewing examiner along with access to the physical evidence.

**Q: What happens when I import a case for confirmation review?**

A: When you import a case ZIP package for review, the case is automatically placed in read-only mode to preserve the integrity of the original work. You can view all annotations, images, and case details, but cannot modify any data. The system validates the package integrity using hashes and ensures you weren't the original examiner (preventing self-confirmation). The imported case appears in your read-only cases list for independent review.

**Q: How do I provide a digital confirmation in Striae?**

A: After importing and reviewing a case, if you confirm the original examiner's conclusions, click the "Confirm" button that appears in the interface. A confirmation modal will open requiring you to enter your full name and badge/ID number. The system then generates a unique confirmation ID and records all your credentials, timestamps, and authentication details as part of the confirmation record.

**Q: What information is included in a confirmation record?**

A: Each confirmation includes comprehensive authentication details: your full name and badge ID (as entered), a human-readable timestamp, a unique system-generated confirmation ID, your user ID and email from your profile, your company/laboratory affiliation, and an ISO timestamp of when the confirmation was created. This provides complete accountability and audit trail information.

**Q: How do I export confirmation data back to the original examiner?**

A: After providing confirmations, navigate to Case Export and look for the "Export Confirmations" button (this only appears if confirmation data exists). Click it to download a JSON file named `confirmation-data-[case]-[timestamp].json`. This file contains all confirmation information with cryptographic hashes for integrity verification. Transfer this file securely back to the original examiner.

**Q: How do I import confirmation data I received from a reviewing examiner?**

A: Navigate to Case Import in the sidebar and select the confirmation JSON file you received (files named `confirmation-data-...`). The system automatically detects confirmation files and validates the data integrity using hashes. It also performs timestamp validation to ensure confirmations weren't created before the annotations were last modified, preventing confirmations of outdated work.

**Q: What security features protect the confirmation process?**

A: The system includes multiple security layers: cryptographic hashes prevent data tampering, self-confirmation prevention blocks original examiners from confirming their own work, timestamp validation ensures confirmations are newer than annotation modifications, unique confirmation IDs provide audit trail tracking, and read-only import mode preserves original work integrity. All validation events are logged for compliance and accountability.

**Q: What happens after confirmation data is imported?**

A: Once confirmation data is successfully imported, the confirmed images become permanently read-only and display confirmation indicators in the interface. No additional confirmations can be added to already-confirmed images. The confirmation information appears in PDF reports with full examiner credentials and unique confirmation IDs. Edit functions are disabled for confirmed images to maintain the integrity of the confirmed work.

**Q: Can I confirm my own work or cases I created?**

A: No, the system specifically prevents self-confirmation to maintain the independence required for proper forensic verification. If you try to import a case package that you originally exported, the system will block the import with an error message. This security measure ensures that confirmations represent genuine independent review by a different examiner.

**Q: What if my confirmation import fails with a hash error?**

A: Hash validation failures indicate the confirmation file may have been modified since it was exported, which compromises forensic integrity. First, verify you received the correct file and that it wasn't corrupted during transfer. If the problem persists, request a new confirmation export from the reviewing examiner. Never attempt to modify confirmation files as this invalidates the cryptographic protection.

**Q: What does timestamp validation check during confirmation import?**

A: The system validates that confirmation timestamps are not earlier than the last modification time of the associated annotation data. This prevents importing confirmations that were created before the annotations were finalized, ensuring confirmations are based on the current version of the work. If validation fails, you'll see an error showing the confirmation time versus annotation modification time.

**Q: How do confirmations appear in PDF reports?**

A: Confirmed images in PDF reports show the confirmation information including the confirming examiner's full name, badge ID, confirmation timestamp, and unique confirmation ID. This provides official documentation of the independent verification for court proceedings and technical reviews. The confirmation details are formatted professionally alongside the examination findings.

**Q: Can I remove or modify confirmations after they're imported?**

A: No, confirmations are permanent and cannot be modified or removed once imported. This immutability is essential for maintaining forensic integrity and audit trails. If there's an error in confirmation data, the reviewing examiner must create a new confirmation export with corrected information, and you must import the new file (the system will prevent duplicate confirmations on the same image).

**Q: What file formats are used for confirmations?**

A: Case exports for confirmation review use ZIP format containing JSON data files and all associated images. Confirmation exports use JSON format with `.json` extension and descriptive filenames. Only these specific formats are accepted to ensure security and data integrity throughout the confirmation process.

**Q: How do I know which of my cases have received confirmations?**

A: Cases with imported confirmations will show confirmation indicators in the interface. Individual images that have been confirmed display confirmation status badges and become read-only. In the case management panel, you can identify cases with confirmations through visual indicators and status information.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many confirmations an image can receive?**

A: Each image can only receive one confirmation to maintain clarity and prevent confusion. Once an image has been confirmed by a reviewing examiner, it cannot receive additional confirmations. This ensures clear accountability and prevents conflicting verification records.

**Q: What should I do if I need to make changes after receiving confirmations?**

A: Images that have been confirmed cannot be modified, as this would invalidate the confirmation. If changes are necessary, you should create a new case with the updated work and follow the confirmation process again. This maintains the integrity of the original confirmed examination while allowing for necessary revisions.

## üìÑ PDF Generation

**Q: How do I generate a professional PDF report?**

A: Generating a polished, case-ready PDF with Striae is straightforward. First, make sure all your annotation data is complete and saved. Use the toolbar to enable only the annotations you wish to include in the report. Then click the Print icon, which initiates the generation process. It usually takes between 15 to 60 seconds, depending on the amount of data. The PDF automatically downloads with a smart, descriptive filename that reflects your case details, ready for printing or saving.

**Q: How does Striae decide what filename to give the PDF?**

A: Filenames are automatically generated to keep reports well-organized and easy to identify. If you‚Äôre making a comparison between two cases, the filename will include both case numbers and item identifiers, for example: `striae-report-2025-001-1A--2025-002-1B.pdf`. For single case reports, it uses the case and item numbers, like `striae-report-2025-001-1A.pdf`. When only the case number is available, it simplifies to `striae-report-2025-001.pdf`. If no case information exists, a timestamp-based filename ensures uniqueness. Invalid characters are automatically sanitized for compatibility.

**Q: What information is included in the PDF reports?**

A: Striae‚Äôs PDFs are professionally formatted to include everything necessary for thorough case documentation. You‚Äôll find the current date and case details in the header. The main image is shown in full resolution, overlaid with selected annotations like case numbers, class characteristics, index marks, and your support level conclusion. Additional notes and observations appear if provided. For identifications, a confirmation signature area is included to meet documentation standards for technical review.

***

## üïµÔ∏è Audit Trail System

**Q: What is the audit trail system in Striae?**

A: Striae automatically tracks all your actions to create a comprehensive audit trail for forensic accountability. The system logs everything you do - from uploading files to creating annotations - ensuring complete traceability for legal compliance. This includes case management activities, file operations, annotation work, user activities, case export/import, document generation, and security events. All data is encrypted with AES-256 and stored securely in Cloudflare infrastructure with 99.999999999% durability.

**Q: How do I access my audit trail data?**

A: You can view your audit trail in two ways: from your "Manage Profile" page, look for the "View My Audit Trail" button, or from the Case Actions Menu, click the purple "Audit Trail" button. The audit viewer opens in a modal window where you can see all your activities with timestamps, filter by date ranges, case numbers, action types, and result status. You can also export your audit data in CSV, JSON, or summary report formats for compliance purposes.

**Q: What types of activities are tracked in my audit trail?**

A: The audit trail captures comprehensive forensic activities including case creation, renaming, and deletion; file uploads, access, and deletion; annotation creation, editing, and deletion; user login/logout and profile updates; case export/import operations; confirmation activities; PDF report generation; and security events like failed logins or blocked actions. Each entry includes detailed information such as timestamps, file details, performance metrics, and security validation results.

**Q: Can I filter and search my audit trail data?**

A: Yes! The audit viewer provides powerful filtering options. You can filter by date ranges using presets (Last 24 hours, Last 7 days, Last 30 days) or custom date ranges, search by specific case numbers, filter by action types (file-upload, annotation-create, case-create, etc.), and filter by result status (success, failure, blocked, warning). You can also combine multiple filters to find exactly the activities you need to review.

**Q: How do I export my audit trail for compliance or legal purposes?**

A: Striae offers three export formats for different purposes. CSV export is best for spreadsheet analysis and includes timestamps, action details, case numbers, and file information. JSON export is ideal for technical analysis and system integration with complete metadata. Summary reports provide human-readable compliance reports with activity statistics and timeline summaries. All exports can be filtered before download and include comprehensive audit information with automatic filename generation including timestamps.

**Q: How long is my audit trail data kept and who can access it?**

A: All audit data is kept permanently to meet forensic compliance and legal evidence requirements. Your audit data is completely isolated from other users - only you can access your own audit trail. System administrators may have access for system maintenance or compliance audits, and data may be accessed if required by law. All data is encrypted at rest with AES-256 encryption and stored in secure Cloudflare infrastructure with automatic tamper-proof protections.

**Q: What should I do if my audit trail seems incomplete or I can't find expected entries?**

A: If audit entries appear missing, first check that your date range filter includes when you performed the work. Clear any case number or action type filters that might be hiding entries. Try refreshing by closing and reopening the audit viewer. Ensure case number filters are spelled correctly if used. For slow loading, use shorter date ranges like "Last 7 days" or apply case-specific filters. For export issues, check that your browser allows downloads and try different export formats if one fails.

***

## üë§ Account Deletion

**Q: How do I delete my Striae account?**

A: To delete your account, go to your user profile page and click the red "Delete Striae Account" button. Deleting your account will permanently remove all your account data, including your user profile, cases, images, annotations, and files. The process is irreversible, so make sure you've archived or downloaded any reports or data you want to keep before proceeding.

**Q: What happens when I delete my account?**

A: Account deletion is comprehensive and permanent. All your account information is removed from our systems. Every case you've created is deleted along with all associated images, annotations, and data files. Your email address is also permanently disabled to prevent any future account creation with the same email. You'll receive a confirmation email once the deletion is complete.

**Q: Can I recover my account after deletion?**

A: No, account deletion is irreversible. Once you confirm the deletion, all your data is permanently removed from Striae's systems and cannot be recovered. If you think you might need your data later, be sure to download any important reports or export your case information before deleting your account.

**Q: Will I get a confirmation that my account was deleted?**

A: Yes, a confirmation email is sent to you confirming your account has been successfully deleted, and an administrative notification is sent to our support team. The email will include details about what was removed and will confirm that your email address has been disabled for future registrations.

**Q: How long does the deletion process take?**

A: Account deletion is immediate and typically completes within a few seconds. You'll receive the confirmation email shortly after the process finishes. The deletion includes removing all your cases, images, and files from our storage systems, so larger accounts may take slightly longer to process completely. Any multi-factor authentication phone numbers you used when you registered your account may take a few days to be disabled.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Q: I see an error saying "Cannot generate PDF - no image selected." What should I do?**

A: This usually means you‚Äôve tried to generate a PDF without selecting an image. To fix it, first confirm you‚Äôve loaded a case that contains uploaded images. Then click on a specific image so it appears in the viewer. After verifying the image is visible, you can generate the PDF successfully.

**Q: Why aren‚Äôt my annotations appearing in my PDF report?**

A: If your annotations don‚Äôt show up, double-check that you‚Äôve saved all your annotation data within the "Image Notes" panel. Also, ensure the correct annotation tools are toggled on in the toolbar before generating the PDF. Missing required fields or working on an unselected image can also cause this issue, so verify those carefully.

**Q: The PDF download isn‚Äôt starting after I click print. How do I fix that?**

A: This may be due to browser restrictions. First, check your browser‚Äôs settings to allow file downloads from the Striae site. Disable any pop-up blockers that might prevent automatic downloads. Clearing your browser cache can also solve this problem. If issues persist, try switching to a different browser‚ÄîChrome is generally recommended for best results.

**Q: Which browsers work best with Striae?**

A: For the smoothest experience, use Chrome, which offers the best performance and compatibility. Firefox is another solid choice with good support for modern web features. Microsoft Edge supports all Striae functionality as well. Safari works but with some advanced features possibly behaving differently.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices

**Q: How should I handle my login credentials securely?**

A: It‚Äôs best practice to use unique, strong passwords for your Striae account and not share them with anyone. A trusted password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords securely. Always log out when you finish your session, especially if you are on a shared or public computer. Regularly update your password to maintain account security.

**Q: What should be included in professional forensic documentation?**

A: Your documentation should follow your department‚Äôs standards for case numbering and use accurate, technical terminology for class characteristics. Detailed observations are essential for peer review, so include sufficient information to support your conclusions. When identifying evidence, enable the confirmation field to include a signature and review date. Use consistent indexing methods throughout the case for clarity.

**Q: How can I best organize my PDF reports?**

A: To maintain order, let Striae‚Äôs automatic filename generation handle your report naming consistently. Organize your reports into folders by case or date for easy retrieval. Keep backup copies in secure, backed-up storage that complies with your department‚Äôs retention policies. Maintaining version control with dated PDFs helps you track any changes over time.
